Users have an insatiable appetite for responsive user interfaces and high-quality multimedia with stringent real-time guarantees on their multicore devices, and they expect better performance or responsiveness as the core count increases. Meeting these expectations requires not only parallelizing client applications but striking the right balance of resources among competing software components. Ideally, applications with strict performance requirements should be given just enough resources to meet these requirements consistently, without unnecessarily siphoning resources from other applications. However, executing multiple parallel, real-time applications while satisfying QoS requirements is a complex optimization problem, and modern applications frequently extend into the cloud, requiring responsiveness and performance predictability on a global scale, which adds additional complexity.  We present PACORA, a resource allocation framework for general-purpose operating systems, which is designed to provide responsiveness guarantees to a simultaneous mix of high-throughput parallel, interactive, and real-time applications in an efficient, scalable manner.
