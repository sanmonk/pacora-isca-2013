\subsection*{Resource Management As Optimization}
The resource management approach taken here attempts to address the new resource allocation challenges described above as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{process} is the entity to which the operating system allocates resources.  Micro-management of the resources within a process is generally application dependent and should be under the control of components of the runtime environment such as a user-mode work scheduler for processor cores or a memory garbage collector for memory pages.
\item The objective function to be minimized is the total \emph{penalty}, which is the sum of the penalties of the runnable processes.
\item The penalty of a process is a function rather than a single value
    and the argument of each penalty function, the \emph{runtime},
    is an appropriate measure of the responsiveness of the process.
    For example,the runtime of a process might be one of these:
    \begin{list}{}{}
    \item The time from a mouse click to its result;
    \item The time from a service request to its response;
    \item The time from job launch to job completion;
    \item The time to execute a specified amount of work.
    \end{list}
\item The runtime of a process is measured or predicted from its history of resource usage.
\end{enumerate}
A succinct mathematical characterization of this resource management scheme is the following:
\begin{eqnarray*}
& \makebox[1in][r]{Minimize}   & \sum_{p\epsilon P} {\pi_p(\tau_p(a_{p,1}\ldots a_{p,n}))}  \\
& \makebox[1in][r]{Subject to} & \sum_{p\epsilon P} a_{p,r} \leq A_r, r = 1,\ldots n        \\
& \makebox[1in][r]{and}        & a_{p,r} \geq 0
\end{eqnarray*}
Here $\pi_p$ is the penalty function for process $p$,
$\tau_p$ is its runtime function,
$a_{p,r}$ is the allocation of resource $r$ to process $p$,
and $A_r$ is the total amount of resource $r$ available.
\subsection*{Convex Optimization}
If the penalty functions, runtime functions, and resource constraints were arbitrarily,
little could be done to optimize the total penalty beyond searching at random for the best allocation.
However, if resource management can be framed as a \emph{convex optimization problem}\cite{BV},
two benefits will accrue: an optimal solution will exist without multiple local extrema, and
fast, incremental solutions will become feasible.

A constrained optimization problem will be convex if both the objective function to be minimized
and the constraint functions that define its feasible solutions are convex functions.
A function $f$ is convex if its domain is a convex set and
$F(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \leq \theta F(x) + (1-\theta)F(y)$
for all $\theta$ between 0 and 1.
A set is convex if for any two points $x$ and $y$ in the set, the point
$\theta x + (1-\theta)y$
is also in the set for all $\theta$ between 0 and 1.
If $F$ is differentiable, it is convex if its domain is an open convex set and
$F(y) \geq F(x) + \nabla F^T(y-x)$ where $\nabla F$ is the gradient of $F$.
Put another way, $F$ is convex if its first-order Taylor approximations
are always global underestimates of its true value.

A convex optimization problem is one that can be expressed in this form:
\begin{eqnarray*}
& \makebox[1in][r]{Minimize}   & f_0(x_1,\ldots x_m)                              \\
& \makebox[1in][r]{Subject to} & f_i(x_1,\ldots f_m) \leq 0, i = 1,\ldots k        \\
& \makebox[1in][r]{where}      & \forall i \quad f_i:\Re^m \rightarrow \Re \mbox{ is convex.}
\end{eqnarray*}
A few more facts about convex functions will be useful in what follows.
First, a \emph{concave} function is one whose negative is convex.
Maximization of a concave function is equivalent to minimization of its convex negative.
An affine function, one whose graph is a straight line in two dimensions or a hyperplane in n dimensions,
is both convex and concave.  A non-negative weighted sum or point-wise maximum (minimum) of convex (concave) functions is convex (concave), as is either kind of function composed with an affine function.  The composition of a convex non-decreasing (concave non-increasing) scalar function with a convex function remains convex (concave).

As a consequence, the resource management problem posed above can be transformed into a convex optimization problem in the $m = |P|\cdot n$ variables $a_{p,r}$ as long as the penalty functions $\pi_p$ are convex non-decreasing and the runtime functions $\tau_p$ are convex.
Note that the resource constraints are all affine and can be rewritten as
$\sum_{p\epsilon P} a_{p,r} - A_r \leq 0$ and $-a_{p,r} \leq 0$.
