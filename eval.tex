%V.	Evaluation%	a.	Models%		i.	Model Accuracy%			1.	Matlab%		ii.	Performance/Overhead%			1.	Tess%				a.	Time to build the model%				b.	Phase Change Reaction%		i.	Video Application adding threads%		ii.	Time to react to phase changes%		iii.	Show model accuracy through transition?%	b.	Decisions%		i.	Decision Accuracy%			1.	Matlab%		ii.	Performance/Overhead%			1.	Tess%	c.	Dynamic System%		i.	Single Application Ð right sizing%			1.	Without phase changes%			2.	With phase changes%			3.	Baseline Ð all allocations%			4.	Measure Energy%		ii.	Video, Animation, and Throughput Applications w/o phase changes%			1.	Show throughput and missed deadlines for all the possible mixes%			2.	Is it possible to show optimal?  %			3.	What is the baseline?%		iii.	Video, Animation, and Throughput Applications w/ phase changes%			1.	Show throughput and missed deadlines for all the possible mixes%			2.	Basically just to show the system works
