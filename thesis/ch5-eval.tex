To evaluate \pacora's ability to make real-time decisions in a real operating system, we implemented it in an in-house research operating system, \tess. We chose to implement in \tess rather than Linux for three reasons:
 \begin{enumerate}\itemsep0pt \parskip0pt \parsep5pt
\item \tess separates resource allocation from scheduling, so is
  closer to the OS architecture assumed by \pacora
\item \tess allows resource revocation, enabling \pacora to dynamically reallocate resources
\item \tess implements additional resource partitioning mechanisms,
  letting \pacora manage  more resource types
\end{enumerate}
This dynamic framework is used to test our implementations of the algorithms, measure the overhead and reaction times, and illustrate \pacora's ability to work in a real system.

\subsection{Platform}
Our dynamic experiments are all run on an Intel Nehalem-EP system with two 2.66-GHz Xeon X5550 quad-core processors and hyperthreading enabled with 16 hardware threads. This system also contains a 1-Gbps Intel Pro/1000 Ethernet network adapter.
\tess allocates resources directly to applications, and the applications employ a second-level scheduler to schedule work onto the resources.  
%There are two scheduling frameworks available in \tess: a cooperative framework called Lithe (LIquid THrEads)~\cite{lithe} and a preemptive one called PULSE (Preemptive User-Level SchEduling).  
All of our experiments use a preemptive scheduling framework called PULSE (Preemptive User-Level SchEduling), with two different scheduling strategies: applications with responsiveness requirements use an earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduler and throughput-oriented applications use a round-robin (GRR) scheduler.

In addition to allocating cores and cache ways as with our static
framework, \tess can also allocate fractions of network bandwidth.  In
our experiments, we show \pacora allocating cores and network
bandwidth because the experimental platform, which has the advantage
of more cores, does not have cache partitioning.  We have also
successfully experimented with additional resources such as memory pages and CPU
utilization, but the results are not presented here for brevity.

\subsection{Performance and Energy Measurement}

Applications report their own measured response times to \pacora
through a message-passing interface built into \tess, and \pacora uses
this information to build models offline or online.  The online models
are identical to our offline models for the same inputs, so the method
used has no effect on resource allocation decisions.  However, online
models are able to adapt changes in applications.  Modeling is
discussed further in Section~\ref{RTFs}.
%and we also use this information to show if the application is making its deadlines for the experiments.

\tess enables \pacora to directly measure the system energy.  However, energy counters are not available on our Nehalem-EP system and thus we extend the power model from the Sandy Bridge system to function as our application 0 RTF.

\subsection{Description of Workloads}
Our workload is designed to represent a video conference with participants from many remote locations. There is a separate, performance-guaranteed incoming video stream for each participant.
%New participants may join the conference and others may leave, increasing or decreasing the number of streams running at any given time.
The application adjusts video sizes based on which person is
speaking. The speaker's video is larger and has higher resolution than
the other video streams, and as the speaker changes, the requirements
for the video streams change. In the background, network-intensive
tasks such as uploading and downloading files are executed.
%While conferencing, compute-intensive tasks such as virus scans or file indexing could be executed in the background.

Our streaming video application is a multi-threaded, CPU- and
network-intensive workload intended to simulate video chat
applications like Skype and Facetime.  Each video stream is encoded
offline in the H.264 format using libx264, transported across the
network through a TCP connection from a Linux E5-based server, and
decoded and displayed by the \tess client. The client receives,
decodes, and displays each frame using libffmpeg and libx264. Each
video stream has a corresponding EDF-scheduled thread with 33 ms
deadlines using our second-level EDF scheduler.  We also use a network
bandwidth hog application designed to represent an application such as
Google Drive or Dropbox uploading files to the cloud. The hog contends
with the video player for bandwidth by constantly sending UDP messages
to the Linux server.

%We use psearchy~\cite{psearchy}, a parallel text indexer, from MOSBENCH\cite{mosbench} as our file indexing application.



\subsection{Resource Allocation Experiments}

We constrain the available resources in the system for \pacora to 1
Mbit/s network bandwidth and 6 cores to simulate a
resource-constrained system as this is a more challenging resource
allocation problem.

In our experiment the video conference contains 6 incoming video
streams.  At first no one is speaking and thus all the videos are
small.  The person speaking rotates across the incoming videos 1--6,
with the videos resizing around every 10 seconds. We set the deadline
to be 33 ms to represent a frame rate of 30 frames/sec. As this rate,
small videos require 80 to 87 kbits/s depending on the particular
frames. Large videos require 250 to 270 kbits/s.  We assign a moderate
penalty (10.0) for missing the deadline to small videos, and a
significant penalty (50.0) for the large videos.  We assign a small
penalty for the network hog (1.0) with no deadline.

Figure~\ref{video_experiment_wp} shows the resource allocations for our video conference scenario when the computer is using ``wall power''.  We mean wall power to imply that saving power is less critical and thus we assign a low penalty slope to application 0.  \pacora gives 90 kbits/s to small videos, 280 kbit/s to large videos, and the remaining bandwidth is given to the network hog.  Video resizes can be seen as the ``steps'' in the graph: for example, Video1 becomes large at 24 seconds resulting in its allocation increasing from 90 kbits/s to 280 kbits/s.  Video2 becomes large at 33 seconds and Video1 returns to its original size.

Since there is a single set of extreme points in a convex problem
after a sufficient number of iterations, our dynamic algorithm will
produce the same allocations as our static framework. The runtime is
controllable based on the exit conditions of the optimization
algorithm, however earlier exits may result in intermediate
reallocations. We can see intermediate resource allocations (the
``columns'' in the graph) as \pacora transitions for one set of
allocations to another.  If run much longer (50 ms), \pacora can
completely eliminate the intermediate allocations, which may be
appropriate in environments where resource reallocation is expensive
and allocations do not need to be adapted frequently.  It is also
possible to provide guaranteed optimization times of around \SI{20}{
\micro\second}, but at the cost of many more intermediate reallocations.
These results can be found in~\cite{pacora_tr}.We choose this
particular point in the space because we believed it strikes the right
balance between reactivity and reallocation amounts for a client
operating system. Figure~\ref{optimization_perf} shows the runtime of
the optimization algorithm as it makes resource allocation decisions
for the video scenario. The algorithm runs in \SI{50}{\micro\second} on average,
with more significant reallocations taking from 250-\SI{350}{\micro\second}.
Significant changes result in 1-2 intermediate reallocations.  In
\tess, network bandwidth is easily reallocated and thus intermediate
reallocations do not have much overhead.  Core allocations are also
easily adjusted between fractional core amounts.  Careful tuning of
the algorithm parameters could potentially yield additional
performance improvements.

Core allocations are also shown in Figure~\ref{video_experiment_wp}.
Neither application in our scenario can take advantage of additional
compute power thus each optimization results in the same core
allocations for the applications regardless of video size.

Figure~\ref{video_experiment_battery} shows same scenario except the
computer is now using ``battery power'' and thus we have increased the
importance of application 0 (penalty 2.0).  The video applications are
still allocated the necessary amount of resources for each video size.
However, the allocation of the network hog is significantly reduced to
less than 70 kbits/s, and the remaining resources are left idle.
