\subsection*{Penalty Functions}

Penalty functions  are generically defined as members of a family of such functions
so that user preferences for a process $p$ (elided in the discussion below)
can be implemented by assigning values to a few well-understood parameters.
As a process grows or diminishes in importance, its penalty function can be modified accordingly.
In a client operating system,the instantaneous management of penalty function modifications
should be highly automated by the system to avoid unduly burdening the user.
\pacora's penalty functions are non-decreasing piecewise linear functions of the form
$\pi(\tau) = \max(0, s(\tau - d)$.
Two representative graphs of this type appear in Figures~\ref{f:pen1} and~\ref{f:pen2}.

}
\end{figure}

The two parameters $d$ and $s$ define the penalty function.
To guarantee it is convex and non-decreasing, $s$ must be non-negative.
The response time $\tau$  is of course non-negative,
and it may be sensible (if not strictly necessary) to convene that $d$ is also.
A response time constrained process has a marked change in slope, namely from 0 to $s$, at the point $\tau= d$.
In the most extreme case $s = \infty$ (implying infinite penalty for the system as a whole when $\tau > d$).  ``Softer'' requirements will doubtless be the rule.
For processes without response time constraints one can set $d = 0$.
This defines linear behavior with $s$ as the rate of penalty increase with response time.

The gradient of process penalty with respect to its resource allocations is useful in controlling the optimization algorithm.
By the chain rule, $\partial\pi/\partial a_r = \partial\pi/\partial\tau\cdot\partial\tau/\partial a_r$.
The first term is well-defined but discontinuous at $\tau = d$ with
$\partial\pi/\partial\tau = \mbox{ if } (\tau - d) \leq 0 \mbox{ then } 0 \mbox{ else } s$.
The problem of estimating the partial derivatives $\partial\tau/\partial a_r$ is dealt with below.

\subsection*{Response Time Functions}

We choose application responsiveness is highly nonlinear for an increasing variety of applications like streaming media or gaming; 

Unlike penalty functions, which describe user preference, a response time function describes process performance based on its resource assignments.
Response time will commonly vary with time as a process changes phase and makes better or worse use of its resources.
To guarantee the objective function is convex, the response time must be also;
this is a plausible requirement akin to the proverbial ``Law of Diminishing Returns''.

Besides the value of the response time function, its gradient or an approximation to it is useful to estimate the relative response time improvement from each type of resource.  A user-level runtime scheduler that schedules work internal to the process may be a good source of data.
Additionally, the resource manager can allocate a modest amount of a resource and measure the change in response time.
Instead of these, \pacora maintains a parameterized analytic response time model with the partial derivatives evaluated from the model \emph{a priori}.

There are examples of response time versus resource behavior that violate convexity.  One such example sometimes occurs in memory allocation, where “plateaus” can sometimes be seen as in Figure~\ref{f:plat}.
\begin{figure}[b]
\parbox{1.6in}{
\includegraphics*{Plateau1.eps}
\caption{\label{f:plat}Response time function with some resource "plateaus".}
}
\hspace{\fill}
\parbox{1.6in}{
\includegraphics*{Plateau2.eps}
\caption{\label{f:plateffect}Net effect of the resource plateaus on the process penalty.}
}
\end{figure}
Such plateaus are typically caused by algorithm adaptations within the process to accommodate variable resource availability.  The response time is really the \emph{minimum} of several convex functions depending on allocation and the point-wise minimum that the process implements fails to preserve convexity.  The effect of the plateaus will be a non-convex penalty as shown in Figure~\ref{f:plateffect} and multiple extrema in the optimization problem will be a likely result.

There are several ways to avoid this problem.  One is based on the observation that such response time functions
will at least be \emph{quasiconvex}.  A function $f$ is quasiconvex if all of its \emph{sublevel sets}
$S_\ell = \{x | f(x) \leq \ell\}$ are convex sets.
Alternatively, $f$ is quasiconvex if its domain is convex and
\begin{displaymath}
f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \leq \max(f(x),f(y)), 0 \leq \theta \leq 1
\end{displaymath}

Quasiconvex optimization can be performed by selecting a threshold $\ell$ and replacing the objective function
with a convex constraint function whose sublevel set $S_\ell$ is the same as that of $f$.
Next, one determines whether there is a feasible solution for that particular threshold $\ell$.
Repeated application with a binary search on $\ell$ will reduce the level of feasibility
until the solution is approximated well enough.

Another idea is to use additional constraints to explore convex sub-domains of $\tau$.
For example,the affine constraint $a_{p,r} - \mu \leq 0$ excludes process $p$ from any assignment of resource $r$ exceeding $\mu$.  Similarly, $\mu - a_{p,r} \leq 0$ exludes the opposite possibility.
A binary (or even linear)search of such sub-domains could be used to find the optimal value.

\pacora adopts a simpler idea, modeling response times by functions that are convex by construction
and do not distort response time behavior too much.  This approach is developed more fully below.

\subsection*{Power and Battery Energy}

It is useful to designate a ``process'' to receive allocations of all resources
that are not used elsewhere and are therefore to be powered off if possible.
In \pacora, process 0 plays this role.
The ``response time'' for process 0, $\tau_0$,
is artificially defined to be the total system power consumption.
This response function is affine and monotone nonincreasing in its arguments $a_{0,r}$.

The penalty function $\pi_0$ can now be used to keep total system power below the parameter $d_0$
to the extent the penalties of other processes cannot overcome its penalty slope $s_0$.
Both $s_0$ and $d_0$ can be adjusted to reflect the current battery charge in mobile devices.
As the battery depletes, $\pi_0$ can be used to force other processes to slow or cease execution.
In any event, the slope $s_0$ establishes a system tradeoff between power and performance that
will determine which processor cores are used for each process and which cores are left idle.

This introduction of \emph{slack} resource allocations into Process 0 turns the resource bounds into equalities:
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{p\epsilon P} a_{p,r} - A_r = 0, r = 1,\dots n.
\end{displaymath}
