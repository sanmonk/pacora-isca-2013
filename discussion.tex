Program phase detection has targeted hardware or software reconfiguration. The overview~\cite{dhodapkar-micro03} evaluates three measurement-based predictors, and while performance variation is not one of the three, the authors note that small performance variation is an indicator of correct phase identification.  A similar conclusion is reached in~\cite{sherwood-sigarch03}.
