\subsection*{\pacora for Warehouse-Scale Computing}
Discuss major differences, particularly storage

\subsection*{Challenges}
\subsubsection*{Outliers and Performance Non-Monotonicity}
Figure~\ref{accuracy_quality} shows the effect of model accuracy on the quality of the resource allocation decisions made.

Discuss Heuristics + Feedback
\subsubsection*{Variability}
Discuss phases, input dependence, other variability (such as network connection), shared resources

Possible solutions include Heuristics + Feedback, Stochastic Models, Changing Models

%Program phase detection has targeted hardware or software reconfiguration. The overview~\cite{dhodapkar-micro03} evaluates three measurement-based predictors, and while performance variation is not one of the three, the authors note that small performance variation is an indicator of correct phase identification.  A similar conclusion is reached in~\cite{sherwood-sigarch03}.
