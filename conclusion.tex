\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\pacora takes a different approach to resource allocation than traditional systems, relying heavily on application-specific functions built through measurement and convex optimization.  Using convex optimization lets \pacora perform real-time resource allocation inexpensively, enabling \pacora to dynamically allocate resources to adjust to the changing state of the the system.  \pacora makes resource allocation decisions in less than 350 $\micro$s in the worst case and often faster than 50 $\micro$s in our manycore OS implementation. By building application-specific functions online and formulating resource allocation as an optimization problem, \pacora is able to accomplish multi-dimensional resource allocation on a general set of resources, thereby handling heterogeneity and the growing diversity of modern hardware while protecting application developers from needing to understand resources. Allocation decisions are near optimal -- only 2\% from the best possible allocation on average, and \pacora only requires a few hundred bytes of additional storage per application.
