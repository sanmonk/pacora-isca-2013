\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\pacora takes a different approach to resource allocation than traditional systems, relying heavily on application-specific functions built through measurement and convex optimization.  Using convex optimization lets \pacora perform real-time resource allocation inexpensively, enabling \pacora to dynamically allocation resources to adjust to the changing state of the the system.  \pacora makes resource allocation decisions in less than 400 microseconds in the worst case and often faster than 40 microseconds in our manycore OS implementation. By building application-specific functions online and formulating resource allocation as an optimization problem, \pacora is able to accomplish multi-dimensional resource allocation on a general set of resources, thereby handling heterogeneity and the growing diversity of modern hardware while protecting application developers from needing to understand resources. Allocation decisions are near optimal --only 2\% from the best possible allocation on average, and \pacora only requires a few hundred bytes of additional storage per application.
