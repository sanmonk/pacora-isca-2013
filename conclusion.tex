\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\pacora takes a different approach to resource allocation than traditional systems, relying heavily on application-specific functions built through measurement and convex optimization.  Using convex optimization lets \pacora perform real-time resource allocation inexpensively.  By building application-specific functions online and formulating resource allocation as an optimization problem, \pacora is able to accomplish multi-dimensional resource allocation on a general set of resources, thereby handling heterogeneity and the growing diversity of modern hardware while protecting application developers from needing to understand resources. \pacora explicitly includes responsiveness requirements and system power and energy in the optimization problem enabling the system make to trade-offs among application responsiveness, system performance, and energy efficiency.
