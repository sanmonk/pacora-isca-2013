\section{Conclusion}
Discuss advantages of \pacora
Possible advantages to discuss:
\begin{itemize}
\item Heterogeneity,
\item Convex optimization is relatively inexpensive optimization problem with good techniques to solve,
\item Penalty Function Slopes allow the system to express relative priorities of application.
\item Priorities change as a function of performance (criticality),
\item Penalty Function Intercept encapsulates QoS requirements (responsiveness),
\item Additional process can be used to represent system energy,
\item Works the growing diversity of modern hardware,
\item doesn't require application developers to know about resources
\end{itemize}
